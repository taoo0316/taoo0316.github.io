**SIGHT**

I absolutely love the colour blue. Here are some of my favourite kind of photos.

**SOUND**

I am into lofi beats and music artists from Taiwan (no particular reason lol). I listen to hip-hop as well.

**NEWS**

My favourite journalist to follow is [Yonden Lhatoo](https://www.scmp.com/author/yonden-lhatoo) from the South China Morning Post (SCMP).

**INSTRUMENTS**

My "favourite" music instrument to play is the saxophone, which is the only instrument I sort of master(ed) :).

**MOVIES**

My favourite movie is Lost in Translation (2003). I also discovered a [Finnish answer](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/01/juho-kuosmanen-interview-compartment-no-6) to the film on a flight to Helsinki :D. Needless to say, Compartment No 6 is also equally amazing.

**LANGUAGES**

Controversial question to ask!! I had a fair amount of exposure to OCaml and Python in college, but I am always looking to learn more. My mother tongue is Mandarin Chinese, and it is the language I am most comfortable conversing in. I mostly write in English now.

**DOCUMENTARIES**

My favourite documentary is [AlphaGo - The Movie](https://youtu.be/WXuK6gekU1Y) by [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/).

**GAMES**

My favourite game is [missed messages](https://store.steampowered.com/app/812810/missed_messages/) by [Angela He](https://store.steampowered.com/developer/zephyo). The music and art style are absolutely stunning.

**CLASSES**

My favourite class in college is Literature and Humanities 2, part of Yale-NUS College's Common Curriculum. You can find some of the texts we read [here](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/academics/overview/common-curriculum/literature-and-humanities-1-and-2/).

My favourite website is [GitHub](https://github.com/taoo0316).

**PHOTOS**

My favourite photo of myself:

This was taken in Ruili One Tree Forest in Yunnan.

**ML/AI**

My favourite person(s) in the field of ML/AI are Cassie Kozyrkov and Demis Hassabis. 

Well, there are a lot more. I chose these two because of their interdisciplinary background. They all inspire me to work harder to become better :).

**HIGH SCHOOL**

![graduation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95064358/197404465-6073a6f1-39ef-4735-9750-3904cc6645e0.jpg)

The photo of my high school graduation! 

Standing beside me is Ms. Yan Youyu, my form teacher and Mathematics teacher, both H2 and H3! She was the recipient of the Lee Kuan Yew Gold Medal in 2008. How cool is that! I will always have fond memories of my time in Hwa Chong. 

**COLLEGE**

My proudest achievement in college is to co-run the Mocktant, a satirical news publication based in Yale-NUS College. We are one of the most popular news sources at the College, and our [telegram channel](https://t.me/themocktant) has over 1000 followers to date.

**SINGAPORE**

Yale-NUS College is ```the``` most beautiful thing that happened to me since coming to this small island. She is home in every sense of the word, and she will live on in all of us who have been so fortunate to be part of her albeit short existence.

**FINLAND**

An unforgettable semester in Helsinki with Rinat and Julene.

![telegram-cloud-photo-size-5-6194936226910418062-y](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95064358/211920146-633ab66f-5f79-4f22-818b-d890bf51a1b7.jpg)

I also got to travel around Europe, which made me realise that life can be much more than the intense competition we feel so much pride taking part in. I started to understand and be more empathetic of the minority experience as well.
