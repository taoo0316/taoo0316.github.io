**Why receive a liberal arts education, especially as a STEM major?**

I always get so tongue-tied when people ask me about my choice of major/college. People who are familiar with my background know that Yale-NUS (RIP), being one of the few institutions worldwide with a need-blind admissions policy for international students, helps relieve a huge financial burden for my family in my pursuit of higher education. In the admissions essay, I also wrote in excruciating detail about my strong desire to receive an interdisciplinary undergraduate education. It is an awkward essay, for sure, but one I still cherish today. It represents my simple and perhaps naive aspiration on what I wanted to do as a 19-year-old boy, fresh out of high school. Alas, one wonders why it cannot be retrieved from the application portal.

Suffice to say, the world changed in a dramatic fashion since that piece of application was sent in. I sometimes also question how, in a world that exalts the relentless pursuit of personal interests, a liberal arts education can be of assistance. I created this entry as a reminder to reflect deeply on what a college education should mean, for me at least.

In descending order of importance:

1. To gain a more lucid understanding of the world we inhabit.

2. To learn, without limits, as much as possible.

3. To gain a specialisation that can serve as the bedrock for future growth and lifelong learning.

4. To receive a college degree that is, for better or worse, still critical in our society.

5. To secure admission into graduate programs/employment.
 

**Don't be too hard on yourself**

Some people say that part of growing up is to accept you are not as special/exceptional as you think you are. I think we all once thought we had what it takes to really achieve something spectacular. Maybe a small part of me still believes that. Yet, life in its ups and downs has gradually revealed that I am not a particularly remarkable human being. Not that there is anything wrong with it. In fact, I'd like to think you shouldn't be too hard on yourself when confronted with that reality. Here is why: 

1. The odds are often stacked against you in the first place. 

2. You don't have as much control as you think over your destiny.

3. Sometimes the best things happen in between. 
 
4. It's not healthy to dwell on comparisons.

5. We are all gonna die. Come on:)

Here is an entry as a reminder to accept my own limitations:)
