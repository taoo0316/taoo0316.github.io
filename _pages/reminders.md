**Why receive a liberal arts education, especially as a STEM major?**

<justify>

I always get so tongue-tied when people ask me about my choice of major/college. People who are familiar with my background know that Yale-NUS (RIP), being one of the few institutions worldwide with a need-blind admissions policy for international students, helps relieve a huge financial burden for my family in my pursuit of higher education. In the admissions essay, I also wrote in excruciating detail about my strong desire to receive an interdisciplinary undergraduate education. It is an awkward essay, for sure, but one I still cherish today. It represents my simple and perhaps naive aspiration on what I wanted to do as a 19-year-old boy, fresh out of high school. Alas, one wonders why it cannot be retrieved from the application portal.

Suffice to say, the world changed in a dramatic fashion since that piece of application was sent in. I sometimes also question how, in a world that exalts the relentless pursuit of personal interests, a liberal arts education can be of assistance. I created this repository as a reminder to reflect deeply on what a college education should mean, for me at least.

In descending order of importance:

1. To gain a more lucid understanding of the world we inhabit.

2. To learn, without limits, as much as possible.

3. To gain a specialisation that can serve as the bedrock for future growth and lifelong learning.

4. To receive a college degree that is, for better or worse, still critical in our society.

5. To secure admission into graduate programs/employment.
