 ```No Promises```

- I am keen to explore a field grounded in sound technical knowledge **and** located at the intersection between the humanities and technology. The search for such a field is an ongoing process.

- Believe it or not, I also plan on writing on a book at some point in my life. It will be a science fiction about migration, languages, colonialism and computer science. I know, the things that go on in my head ......

- I would love to get a cat and name him/her/they "kingfisher". If you know, you know.

- It would be lovely to spend a prolonged period of time in Hong Kong, a city that always fascinated me.
