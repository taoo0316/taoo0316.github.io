ðŸ§  Hi there, I am Wentao. I am a computer science student a [Yale-NUS College](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/), the leading liberal arts college in Asia. There, I was able to take classes across disciplines and academic traditions, which helped me become a more methodical thinker, learner and communicator.
