ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I am Wentao, a research assistant at the [Digital Medicine Lab](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/liunan/) of [Duke-NUS Medical School](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Liu Nan](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/directory/detail/liu-nan). 

I am broadly interested in interpretable machine learning and health data science. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in computer science and statistics from [Yale-NUS College](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/).

I grew up in [Xuchang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuchang) and moved to the provincial capital [Zhengzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhengzhou) when I was 12. At age 15, I boarded my first international flight and moved to the [little red dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_red_dot) with the generous support of Singapore's Ministry of Education.

```Fun fact: My hometown was the warlord Cao Cao's de facto capital during the late Eastern Han Dynasty. It is also now a world-renowned manufacturing centre for wigs and hair extensions.```

Check out what projects I have been up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/taoo0316)! Also, here is a surprisingly accurate [pronunciation](https://www.howtopronounce.com/wentao) of my name if you are having trouble. You may also check out my [terminal](https://live-term-taoo0316.vercel.app/) website and [single-page](https://zola-hallo-taoo0316.vercel.app/) website.
