<style>body {text-align: justify}</style>

ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I am Wentao, a computer science student at [Yale-NUS College](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/), the leading liberal arts college in Asia. There, I was able to take classes across disciplines and academic traditions, which helped me become a more methodical thinker, learner and communicator.

I grew up in [Xuchang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuchang) and moved to the provincial capital [Zhengzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhengzhou) when I was 12. At age 15, I boarded my first international flight and moved to the [little red dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_red_dot) with the generous support of Singapore's Ministry of Education. 

I will be applying for master's programs in data science/machine learning in 2024.

Check out what projects I have been up to! Also, here is a surprisingly accurate [pronunciation](https://www.howtopronounce.com/wentao) of my name if you are having trouble. 

**What I can do for you**

I am deeply interested in making data useful for industry needs and researchers alike. This means cleaning the data, feature engineering, building machine learning models/pipelines, making queries from databases or developing impactful visualisation.
