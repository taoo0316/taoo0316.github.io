Hey! I am Wentao, a computer science student a [Yale-NUS College](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/), the leading liberal arts college in Asia. There, I was able to take classes across disciplines and academic traditions, which helped me become a more methodical thinker, learner and communicator.

I will be applying for master's programs in data science/machine learning in 2024.

Check out what projects I have been up to!
